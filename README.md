### Notes

The only difficulties I've ran into this week were trying to wrap my head around last week and this week's topics and how they are working for this specific app. Other than that, the only other difficulties I'm running into are GitHub. I'm still trying to understand the terminal commands. I'm pretty sure I accidentally diverged my local and remote branches. So, in order to avoid any more difficulties and challenges, I left it as is for this project. Hopefully, everything that's required is up-to-date.

### Notes
I had a few issues actually getting data to be viewed on the emulator, which was caused by a syntax error. Fixing this error quickly resolved my issue.
